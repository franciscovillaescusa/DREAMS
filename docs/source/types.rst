Simulation types
================

Ideally, we would like to have simulations covering a volume as large as possible (to enhance statistics) with the highest possible resolution (to better identify dark matter effects). Unfortunately, at a limited computing time, one needs to make a tradeoff between those. In DREAMS, we balance this by running simulations that cover different physical scales at different resolutions.

.. Important::

   In the quest of astrophysical signatures of dark matter properties we also face the challenge of choosing between large statistics at low-resolution versus low statistics at high-resolution.

The DREAMS simulations can then be classified into three categories, depending on the mass resolution, spatial resolution, and the environment they prove:

- Cosmological boxes
- Milky-way zoom-ins
- Dwarfs zoom-ins

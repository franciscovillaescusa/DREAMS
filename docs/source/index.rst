The DREAMS project
==================

DREAMS stands for **D**\a\ **R**\k matt\ **E**\r with **A**\I and si\ **M**\ulation\ **S**, and it is a project designed to combine astrophysics with particle physics through machine learning in order to shed light on the nature of dark matter and to learn about the physics that shapes the Universe on small scales. For this purpose, DREAMS will generate thousands of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations with different astrophysics and dark matter models on different environments.
